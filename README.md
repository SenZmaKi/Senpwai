# Senpwai

Python console app that automates downloading complete seasons of anime

The app applies web scraping techniques using BeautifulSoup and Selenium to automate the download process

Wrote it cause I got tired of clicking links upon links and a having a billion tabs on my browser, Mendokusai naa


## Installation

### Pre-requisites

Currently only works on Windows OS

You'll need to have Chrome installed

Support for Firefox coming soon

### For the non-tech savvy users

I converted the python code to an executable, the link to the releases is down below:

https://github.com/SenZmaKi/Senpwai/releases

Just run it normally like an app, Senpwai will handle the rest



### For the nerds

To install all the libraries I used in your virtual environment, once you clone the repository run 

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Then just run the code as you would normally do

If you want to build it into an executable like I did, run

```pyinstaller --onefile --icon=Senpwai_icon.ico --add-data "audio;audio" Senpwai.py```


## Epilogue
Hopefully Senpwai helps a clown like me out there too

Gambarte and take care of Senpwai for me, she's a fragile one
