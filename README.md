# Senpwai

Python console app that automates downloading complete seasons of anime from animepahe.ru

The script applies web scraping techniques to automate the download process

Wrote it cause I got tired of clicking links upon links and a having a billion tabs on my browser, Mendokusai naa


## Installation

### Pre-requisites

You'll need to have either Edge or Chrome installed on your system, support for Firefox comming soon

### For the non-tech savvy users

I converted the python script to an executable you can find it in the link below:

https://github.com/SenZmaKi/Senpwai/releases/download/v1.1.1/Senpwai.exe

Just run it normally like an app, Senpwai will handle the rest



### For the nerds

Once you clone the repository run 

```pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt```

to install all the libraries I used in your virtual environment

Then just run the code as you would normally do

You can also just download the file stead of cloning then follow the same process


## Epilogue
Hopefully Senpwai helps a clown like me out there too

Gambarte and take care of Senpwai for me, she's a fragile one
