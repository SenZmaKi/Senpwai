# Senpwai

Python script that automates downloading anime from animepahe.ru

The script applies web scraping techniques to automate the download process

Wrote it cause I got tired of clicking links upon links and a having a billion tabs on your my browser, Mendokusai naa


## Installation

### For the non-tech savvy users

I converted the python script to an executable you can find it in the link below:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/176N4qhMvWwiU5ofpUu7uXhvdYhUsd3hX/view?usp=share_link

Just run it normally like an app, Senpwai will handle the rest



### For the nerds

Once you clone the repository run 

```pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt```

to install all the libraries I used in your virtual environment

Then just run the code as you would normally do

I would advise using the .py file stead of the .ipynb cause I simply converted the .py to a notebook so the notebook has a lot of syntax errors

You can also just download the file stead of cloning then follow the same process


## Epilogue
Hopefully Senpwai helps a clown like me out there too

Gambarte and take care of Senpwai for me, she's a fragile one
